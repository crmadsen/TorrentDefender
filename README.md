# Torrent Defender

Killswitch program that queries VPN status and kills network/torrent client connection when the VPN drops.

Currently works with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Transmission 2.84, and PIA Client v.72. Future versions will allow 
selection of various clients and VPN services

## Getting Started

Open Terminal, type 'sudo python TorrentDefender.py', enter password

Once the GUI loads, click Enable

Software will monitor VPN connection in tandem with the Bittorrent client. When running, the client cannot be run without the VPN active.
When a drop in the VPN connection is detected, the network connection is immediately killed, followed by the BT client. Once the program
has determined the BT software is no longer running, the network connection is brought back online. 

### Installing

Software is source and must be run with Python or compiled.
